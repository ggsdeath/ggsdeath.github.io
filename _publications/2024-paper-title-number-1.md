excerpt: 'In this paper, we introduce a benchmark to evaluate association, a core yet underexplored aspect of human intelligence. We construct adjective- and verb-based tasks using an annotation-free method and propose three association levels: single-step, synchronous, and asynchronous. Extensive zero-shot evaluations reveal that current MLLMs, including GPT-4V, perform significantly worse than humans. Our benchmark offers a new direction for advancing MLLM research.'
