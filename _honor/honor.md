Hello! I am a second-year undergraduate student majoring in [Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes **3D vision** and **embodied AI**. I previously conducted a research internship at [RHOS](https://mvig-rhos.com/), working under the supervision of [Prof. Yong-Lu Li](https://dirtyharrylyl.github.io/) and [Prof. Cewu Lu](https://www.mvig.org/).
